# Metrica Vox Machina
> **Gold Standard Computational Linguistics Evaluation for AI**

**Note**: While the system is confirmed to meet 100% of focus-group led requirements, it was time and scope limited as 26,000+ words had to be simultaeneously authored for the accompanying thesis, crucial for the fulfillment of the Master of Science (Computer Science) degree schema.

For university submission and mark tracing purposes, the code has been condensed into a single file. Originally, the project's `tkinter` functionality and package-based logic spanned across 20+ files. A comprehensive, web-based version of Metrica Vox Machina is slated for release. The full project code will be uploaded after mark ratification.

## 📌 Overview
The recent surge in the adoption of large language models, especially post-GPT-3, underscores the need for standardized, user-friendly evaluation tools. "Metrica Vox Machina" rises to this challenge, offering a suite of evaluative tools designed to rigorously assess the performance of these language models across varied chat-based domains and functionalities.

## 📃 Abstract
The recent meteoric rise in adopƟon of large language models, parƟcularly since the launch of GPT-3, 
have catalysed the creaƟon of a spectrum of compeƟng models each boasƟng unique specialiƟes 
derived from their respecƟve training corpora. With increasing heterogeneity of models contribuƟng 
to a growing complexity for the evaluaƟon of these language models, this study addresses the 
pronounced need for an evaluaƟve system with a standardised, user-friendly approach to tesƟng a 
breadth of language models for cross-industrial funcƟonality as a contribuƟon to AI safety. This study 
contains the raƟonal basis, design and implementaƟon for the LLM evaluaƟon system “Metrica Vox 
Machina”, a tool embodying a synthesis of empirically validated and industrially deployed evaluaƟve 
methods. Three standardised suites of evaluaƟon have been developed; firstly, a bidirecƟonal, 50-
language supported machine translaƟon tool, secondly, a cross-comparaƟve human evaluaƟon tool 
with a JSON-validaƟng dataset manager and finally, a contextual embedding tool with smart CUDA 
core threading and format-specific data validaƟon. ConƟnuously evaluated weekly during and post implementation periods, the system conclusively meets and exceeds its iniƟal requirements, proving 
to be a highly effecƟve tool for its intended incrementally designed use, the conƟnuous evaluaƟon of 
modern AI.
