# Metrica Vox Machina
> Gold Standard Computational Linguistics Evaluation for AI

Full release of Metrica Vox Machina will be in web-based form. Project code to be uploaded after mark ratification (Nov, 2023).

Note: This code has been simplified into a single file for mark tracing reasons (and university submission limitations). Originally, all tkinter functionality was separated from package-based logic across 20+ files.

🌍 **Location**: Birmingham, UK  
🏛 **Institution**: University of Birmingham  
📅 **Duration**: May 2022 - Sep 2023

## 📌 Overview
The recent surge in the adoption of large language models, especially post-GPT-3, underscores the need for standardized, user-friendly evaluation tools. "Metrica Vox Machina" rises to this challenge, offering a suite of evaluative tools designed to rigorously assess the performance of these language models across varied domains and functionalities.

## 📃 Abstract
The modern landscape of language models, each with its unique specializations, demands a robust evaluative system with a standardized approach. This study dives deep into the creation and utility of "Metrica Vox Machina", including:
- **Bidirectional Machine Translation**: Supporting 50 languages.
- **Human Evaluation Tool**: With JSON-validating dataset management.
- **Contextual Embedding Tool**: Enhanced with CUDA core threading and data validation.

Continuous evaluations indicate that the system adeptly meets its design objectives.
